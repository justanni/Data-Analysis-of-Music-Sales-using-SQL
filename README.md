# Data-Analysis-of-Music-Sales-using-SQL
This project leverages SQL to perform comprehensive data analysis on a music retail database. The aim is to extract valuable insights that can aid in strategic planning, marketing, and decision-making processes within the music retail industry. By querying various interconnected tables containing information about employees, customers, invoices, tracks, artists, albums, genres, media types, and playlists, we derive meaningful conclusions about sales patterns, customer behavior, and music genre popularity across different regions.

Employee: Details about employees, including their hierarchy and contact information.
Customer: Information about customers and their support representatives.
Invoice: Records of invoices linked to customers.
Invoice Line: Detailed line items within invoices.

Artist: Information about music artists.
Album: Albums created by artists.
Genre: Various music genres.
Media Type: Different media formats.
Playlist: User-curated playlists.
Playlist Track: Tracks included in playlists.
